Script for summarizing and plotting the results of the selfish detour benchmark.

This script doesn't have a real command-line interface. It's intended to be
modified directly to suit your needs.

= Default Usage =
./analyze.py
By default the script will read whatever files are in the folder named_results/
and output pdf plots of them to "plots/". File names will be used as titles in
the output plots.

= Other Usage =
I recommend looking at main() in analyze.py to see what gets called when. After
that you may want to play around with some of the commented-out lines.
