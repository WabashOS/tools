Selfish detour benchmark

Measures noise on a system by polling the RDTSC instruction. Output is a CSV of
all interruptions.

= Usage =
./detour [-n NITER, -o OUTPUT_TYPE]
  -n NITER
    Number of detours to record. Runtime depends on this and the rate of detours.

  -o OUTPUT_TYPE
    Specifies an output type.
      f - file (./results.out)
      n - Network (socket on port 12345)
      c - Console (stdout)

= Building =
make detour     - Builds benchmark for native platform
make detour.rr  - Builds for rumprun

= Notes =
Derived from the netgauge benchmark suite:
  http://htor.inf.ethz.ch/research/netgauge/

I basically just extracted out the selfish-detour bit and put a simpler
front-end on it. This makes it easier to port, cross-compile, and run on weird
systems.
