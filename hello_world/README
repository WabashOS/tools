A basic hello-world utility that can test multiple output methods.

= hello =
Usage: ./hello [-c, -n, -f]
Prints hello to the desired output method.
  -c
    Console output (stdout)
  -n
    Network output (port 12345)
    Use netcat to retrieve "nc  IP:12345"
  -f
    (DEFAULT) File output (hello.out).

= hello_pth =
Usage ./hello [-c, -n, -f]
Prints hello on multiple threads after constant work (currently ~20s of work).
Useful for testing multi-threaded features (for instance, rumprun takes
Nthread*20s to run because it doesn't support multiple cores).

= *_rr =
Example:
  $ make hello_rr
  $ ./rr_run hello.rr -c

Builds the corresponding test for rumprun (run with tools/rumprun/rr_run.sh).
